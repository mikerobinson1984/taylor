		<p>Taylor&Emmet’s team of Clinical Negligence specialist solicitors act solely for the victims of medical and surgical negligence. 
		  
	  </p>
		<p>Clinical negligence usually causes an unexpected and serious breach of a patient’s trust in a medical professional. It also leaves people devastated through serious physical injury and emotional trauma.		  </p>
		<p>Our specialist team members will deal with each case sensitively, with the best interests of our client being paramount at all times. 
		  
		  All medical practitioners have a duty to take reasonable care when managing their patients, whether simply by referring a patient to a specialist in the light of certain symptoms, or by carrying out complex, major surgery. When a medical practitioner fails in meeting this duty, then patients may be left injured. </p>
		<p>They often feel helpless in dealing with a large Health Trust which may not want to listen to the complaints of patients, no matter how genuine they are. </p>
