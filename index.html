		<p>Taylor&Emmet is proud to be among the first solicitors in Sheffield to be accredited to the Conveyancing Quality Scheme, an initiative run by the Law Society to recognise professional excellence and demonstrate the credibility of members. We are also one of the only regional firms to be accepted into the Conveyancing Association, which gives us a unique opportunity to help shape the future of industry.

		<p>Taylor&Emmet’s team of Clinical Negligence specialist solicitors act solely for the victims of medical and surgical negligence. 
		  
	  </p>
		<p>Clinical negligence usually causes an unexpected and serious breach of a patient’s trust in a medical professional. It also leaves people devastated through serious physical injury and emotional trauma.		  </p>
		<p>Our specialist team members will deal with each case sensitively, with the best interests of our client being paramount at all times. 

		  All medical practitioners have a duty to take reasonable care when managing their patients, whether simply by referring a patient to a specialist in the light of certain symptoms, or by carrying out complex, major surgery. When a medical practitioner fails in meeting this duty, then patients may be left injured. </p>
		<p>They often feel helpless in dealing with a large Health Trust which may not want to listen to the complaints of patients, no matter how genuine they are. </p>
